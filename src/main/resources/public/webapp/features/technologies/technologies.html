    <p>Here is a list of some technologies, techniques and software I've been working with.</p>
    <table class="grid">
        <tr>
            <th>Technology</th>
            <th>Descriptor</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>JSON</th>

        <tr>
            <th>Xpath</th>
            <th><p>Creates queries on xml files, this can be used to narrow results from large files or define rules on</p></th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Jenkins</th>
            <th><p>Using Jenkins both for the handling of services as well the application of scripts to moderate code projects.</p></th>

        <tr>
            <th>Sonarqube</th>
            <th><p>Using Jenkins both for the handling of services as well the application of scripts to moderate code projects.</p></th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>JAXB</th>
            <th><p>I quite like systems store data, Jaxb is a very neat way of handling POJOs as XML objects; this can prove
                invaluable for creating and handling requests in codes as well as storage purposes.</p></th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Spring Framework</th>
            <th><p>Spring has many libraries that support REST endpoints as well as tomcat servlet hosting using springboot; a personal favourite as it allows me to locally host my servers for debugging purposes</p></th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Remote Debugging</th>
            <th><p>Although more of a technique, it can prove invaluable to trace errors as they happen; making requests and
                keeping a track on variables can give you insight to obscure issues hidden behind dependency based projects. Keeping an eye out for integrity of code
                can help identify weaknesses that might have been overlooked during the creation of the testing process</p></th>
