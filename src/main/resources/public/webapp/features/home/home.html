	<h3>Welcome!</h3>
	<p>Here is my testing website that'll be under continuous
		development, it demonstrates example technologies through
		implementation and covers topics that I will cover to better my
		understanding of back-end development.</p>
	<p>I apologise for the layout, CSS isn't my priority but something that will develop in extra time as I get a better foundation in front end development in my spare time.</p>
	<p>Should you wish to know more about me and my efforts, please feel free to investigate the <a ui-sref="about" style="font-weight:bold">about page</a> I've set up.</p>
