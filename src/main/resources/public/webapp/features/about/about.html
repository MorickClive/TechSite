		<h1>About</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>
			This site is purely dedicated to the hosting of technologies including Spring Boot and Microservices, 
			during the development of this site I hope to establish a platform in which may become my technical portfolio.
		</p>
		<p>
			Although this site is a little disjointed, the CSS and interaction to the HTML is something that'll be adjusted in development.
			Currently it'll serve to host technologies that I will study throughout my time in deployment and on the bench with QA Consulting.
