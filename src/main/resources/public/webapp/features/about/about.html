		<h1>About</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>
			This site is dedicated towards keeping track of the various skills I've picked up whilst working in the IT industry.
		</p>
		<p>
			Although this site is a little disjointed, the CSS and interaction to the HTML is something that'll be adjusted in development.
			Currently it'll serve to host technologies that I will study throughout my time in deployment and on the bench with QA Consulting.
			I could use a bootstrap template, but part of what drives me to learn is to do something myself; experiencing development and the creation
            of something entirely new.
